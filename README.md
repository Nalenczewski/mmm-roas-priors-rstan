# Geo-Hierarchical Media Mix Model with ROAS Priors in Rstan

This code is an implementation of the simulation in the Google paper [Media Mix Model Calibration with Bayesian Priors](https://research.google/pubs/media-mix-model-calibration-with-bayesian-priors/), which shows how to incorporate ROAS values obtained through experimentation into a media mix model.
